Without proper controls, teams risk:\n\n- Unauthenticated access to high-cost APIs\n- Loss of visibility into who is prompting models\n- Data exposure from unverified users\n- Difficulty enforcing usage limits or quotas\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to use **Envoy AI Gateway** with **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** to secure access to OpenAI's API from within your Kubernetes environment.\n\n## Why OIDC?\n\nOIDC is a widely adopted identity layer built on OAuth 2.0. It allows users to authenticate using identity providers like:\n\n- Google Workspace\n- Okta\n- Auth0\n- Azure AD\n\nWith OIDC in place, you can:\n- Enforce login for any prompt or API request\n- Identify users via JWT claims\n- Apply policy per identity or group\n- Audit access logs for security and billing\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n```\n[ Dev Portal / CLI ]\n        |\n    [ OIDC Login ]\n        |\n[ Envoy AI Gateway ] --> [ OpenAI API ]\n        |\n     Policies\n   (rate limits, auth)\n```\n\n## Step 1: Configure Envoy AI Gateway with OIDC\n\nExample Gateway configuration using OIDC:\n\n```yaml\nauthentication:\n  - provider:\n      name: oidc-auth\n      issuer: https://auth.myorg.com\n      clientId: envoy-gateway\n      jwksUri: https://auth.myorg.com/.well-known/jwks.json\n```\n\nYou can enforce this policy on any route (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`) and require a valid bearer token signed by your IdP.\n\n## Step 2: Map JWT Claims to Policy\n\nWith OIDC tokens available at the gateway, you can apply advanced controls:\n\n- Rate limits by `email` or `sub` (subject ID)\n- RBAC by `groups` claim\n- Token quotas by `tenant_id` or `project_id`\n\nExample policy snippet:\n\n```yaml\nrateLimits:\n  - name: user-limit\n    match:\n      path: /v1/chat/completions\n      claims:\n        email: \"*@myorg.com\"\n    requestsPerUnit: 100\n    unit: minute\n```\n\n## Step 3: Enforce Logging and Auditing\n\nEnvoy AI Gateway integrates with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry to expose:\n\n- Which user made each request\n- Which endpoints were hit\n- Request latency and failure rates\n- JWT claims used to authorize traffic\n\n## Bonus: Multi-Tenant Support\n\nOIDC + Envoy AI Gateway makes it easy to isolate access by team, project, or product by parsing tenant IDs from JWT claims or request headers.\n\nExample: apply a token budget per team:\n\n```yaml\ntokenBudgets:\n  - tenant: marketing\n    maxTokens: 100000\n    period: month\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith just a few lines of configuration, you can enforce secure, authenticated, and observable access to OpenAI—without writing custom middleware or proxies.\n\nEnvoy AI Gateway makes it easy to:\n- Enforce enterprise SSO and zero-trust policies\n- Set per-user or per-group usage controls\n- Observe LLM usage patterns at the edge\n\n---\n\n🔐 **Secure your OpenAI usage today**  \n📘 [See the full OIDC configuration guide](#)  \n🚀 [Deploy Envoy AI Gateway in your cluster](#)","src/content/blog/secure-openai-oidc.md","7d083d9f9b4bfe22",{"html":362,"metadata":363},"\u003Ch1 id=\"secure-openai-access-with-oidc-in-kubernetes-using-envoy-ai-gateway\">Secure OpenAI Access with OIDC in Kubernetes Using Envoy AI Gateway\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>As generative AI becomes integral to internal tools and user-facing products, securing access to model APIs like OpenAI’s becomes critical.

Here's why your platform team needs one.","# What Is an AI Gateway and Why You Need One\n\nAPI gateways have long been essential for securing and managing service traffic in microservice architectures. But AI workloads introduce fundamentally new challenges—ones that traditional gateways were never designed to handle.\n\nThat's where **AI Gateways** come in.\n\n## Why AI Workloads Need a New Kind of Gateway\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) and generative AI APIs differ from traditional services in three key ways:\n\n- **They’re expensive** — API calls often consume tokens billed by request, word, or model compute time.\n- **They’re sensitive** — LLMs may return user-generated data, require privacy controls, or demand robust authentication.\n- **They’re unpredictable** — With prompt engineering, model chaining, and multiple downstream services, usage patterns are hard to enforce without policy control.\n\nAs platform teams begin to productize AI for internal and external use, these issues become operational bottlenecks—and security risks.\n\n## What Does an AI Gateway Do?\n\nAn **AI Gateway** sits between clients (apps, developers, services) and your AI model endpoints (like OpenAI, Claude, or Hugging Face TGI). It provides:\n\n- 🔐 **Authentication and Authorization**  \n  Enforce OIDC, mTLS, and role-based access control (RBAC) per route or tenant.\n\n- ⏳ **Rate Limiting and Token Budgeting**  \n  Limit not just requests per minute, but also total tokens, prompt sizes, or cost-based quotas.\n\n- 📊 **Prompt Observability**  \n  Track who is sending prompts, how many tokens are used, what latency or error rates occur, and what content is passing through.\n\n- 🔍 **Policy Enforcement and Governance**  \n  Sanitize prompts, redact PII, block abuse patterns, and ensure LLM use aligns with company policies.\n\n## How Is It Different from a Traditional API Gateway?\n\nHere’s a quick comparison:\n\n| Feature                         | API Gateway | AI Gateway |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Token-based rate limiting      | ❌          | ✅         |\n| Prompt observability           | ❌          | ✅         |\n| LLM-specific usage policies    | ❌          | ✅         |\n| OpenAI/HuggingFace compatibility | ❌        | ✅         |\n| Native Kubernetes integration  | ⚠️ (varies) | ✅         |\n| Support for multi-tenant access| ⚠️          | ✅         |\n\n## Use Cases for an AI Gateway\n\n- **Control OpenAI access** for internal developers with SSO and usage quotas.\n- **Expose Hugging Face models** to front-end apps with fine-grained policies.\n- **Monitor LLM cost usage** and set alerts before budgets are exceeded.\n- **Prevent prompt injection** and ensure safe, compliant prompt handling.\n\n## Meet Envoy AI Gateway\n\n**Envoy AI Gateway** is an open-source, Kubernetes-native solution built on Envoy Proxy and the Gateway API.

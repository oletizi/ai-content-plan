# What Is an AI Gateway and Why You Need One

API gateways have long been essential for securing and managing service traffic in microservice architectures. But AI workloads introduce fundamentally new challenges—ones that traditional gateways were never designed to handle.

That's where **AI Gateways** come in.

## Why AI Workloads Need a New Kind of Gateway

Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI APIs differ from traditional services in three key ways:

- **They’re expensive** — API calls often consume tokens billed by request, word, or model compute time.
- **They’re sensitive** — LLMs may return user-generated data, require privacy controls, or demand robust authentication.
- **They’re unpredictable** — With prompt engineering, model chaining, and multiple downstream services, usage patterns are hard to enforce without policy control.

As platform teams begin to productize AI for internal and external use, these issues become operational bottlenecks—and security risks.

## What Does an AI Gateway Do?

An **AI Gateway** sits between clients (apps, developers, services) and your AI model endpoints (like OpenAI, Claude, or Hugging Face TGI). It provides:

- 🔐 **Authentication and Authorization**  
  Enforce OIDC, mTLS, and role-based access control (RBAC) per route or tenant.

- ⏳ **Rate Limiting and Token Budgeting**  
  Limit not just requests per minute, but also total tokens, prompt sizes, or cost-based quotas.

- 📊 **Prompt Observability**  
  Track who is sending prompts, how many tokens are used, what latency or error rates occur, and what content is passing through.

- 🔍 **Policy Enforcement and Governance**  
  Sanitize prompts, redact PII, block abuse patterns, and ensure LLM use aligns with company policies.

## How Is It Different from a Traditional API Gateway?

Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature                         | API Gateway | AI Gateway |
|--------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Token-based rate limiting      | ❌          | ✅         |
| Prompt observability           | ❌          | ✅         |
| LLM-specific usage policies    | ❌          | ✅         |
| OpenAI/HuggingFace compatibility | ❌        | ✅         |
| Native Kubernetes integration  | ⚠️ (varies) | ✅         |
| Support for multi-tenant access| ⚠️          | ✅         |

## Use Cases for an AI Gateway

- **Control OpenAI access** for internal developers with SSO and usage quotas.
- **Expose Hugging Face models** to front-end apps with fine-grained policies.
- **Monitor LLM cost usage** and set alerts before budgets are exceeded.
- **Prevent prompt injection** and ensure safe, compliant prompt handling.

## Meet Envoy AI Gateway

**Envoy AI Gateway** is an open-source, Kubernetes-native solution built on Envoy Proxy and the Gateway API. It was designed specifically for the challenges of production AI.

You can use it to:
- Secure model APIs with zero-trust security
- Control costs with token-aware rate limiting
- Gain visibility into AI usage across teams and tenants

Whether you're building a platform for AI copilots, chatbots, document understanding, or agent workflows—**an AI Gateway should be your first line of defense and control**.

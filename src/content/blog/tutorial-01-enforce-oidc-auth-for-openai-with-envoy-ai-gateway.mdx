# Authenticate OpenAI Traffic in Kubernetes with OIDC and Envoy AI Gateway

Uncontrolled access to OpenAI can lead to shadow usage, security gaps, and surprise bills. By enforcing OIDC via Envoy AI Gateway, you can ensure that only authenticated and authorized users are able to access LLM endpoints.

## What You'll Learn

- How to configure Envoy AI Gateway with OIDC (e.g., Auth0, Okta, Google)
- How to intercept OpenAI requests and enforce login
- How to forward JWT claims for audit and policy control

## Use Case
You want your internal dev portal to require SSO login before using GPT-based tools. You also want to:

- Apply tenant-based rate limits
- Track usage per authenticated user

## Sample Policy Snippet
```yaml
authentication:
  - provider:
      name: oidc-auth
      issuer: https://auth.myorg.com
      clientId: envoy-gateway
      jwksUri: https://auth.myorg.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

**Secure model access, maintain audit trails, and support zero trust architecture.**

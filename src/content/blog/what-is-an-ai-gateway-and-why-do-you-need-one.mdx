# What Is an AI Gateway and Why Do You Need One?

You’ve secured your microservices with ingress controllers. You’ve adopted API gateways for external traffic. But what about your AI models?

Traditional gateways weren't built for:

- Prompt payloads that consume tokens and dollars
- Models that need usage controls across tenants
- Observability of LLM inputs and outputs

## Enter the AI Gateway
An **AI Gateway** sits in front of model endpoints—like OpenAI, Claude, or internal Hugging Face models—and provides:

- 🔐 Authentication and authorization (OIDC, mTLS)
- ⏱️ Rate limiting and token budgets
- 📊 Prompt observability and usage tracking
- 📜 Policy enforcement and traffic governance

## Do You Need One?
You do, if:

- You have multiple teams accessing shared LLMs
- You’re worried about API abuse, quota blowouts, or compliance
- You want to scale your AI platform with confidence

**Envoy AI Gateway** was built for this exact use case.

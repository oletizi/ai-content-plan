# How to Rate Limit OpenAI Access in Kubernetes Using Envoy AI Gateway

LLMs are powerful—and expensive. Without controls, a single integration can burn through your OpenAI quota in minutes.

**Envoy AI Gateway** helps you:

- Intercept and control requests to OpenAI
- Apply per-user or per-service quotas
- Track request and token usage

## What You’ll Learn
- How to deploy Envoy AI Gateway in your cluster
- Define Gateway API resources with rate-limiting policies
- Configure token budgets and enforce per-tenant usage
- Monitor usage with built-in telemetry

## Example Policy
```yaml
rateLimits:
  - name: openai-limit
    match:
      path: /v1/chat/completions
    requestsPerUnit: 100
    unit: minute
```

This allows you to safely expose OpenAI while keeping costs under control.

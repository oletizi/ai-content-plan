# AI Gateway vs API Gateway: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters

API gateways have become the default ingress layer for modern applications. But when it comes to AI workloads, they fall short:

| Challenge             | API Gateway | AI Gateway |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|
| Token-based limits   | ❌          | ✅         |
| Prompt observability | ❌          | ✅         |
| AI-specific policies | ❌          | ✅         |
| LLM cost control     | ❌          | ✅         |
| Gateway API native   | ⚠️          | ✅         |

## What Makes an AI Gateway Different?

AI Gateways handle **model-specific traffic patterns**, including:

- Large prompt payloads
- High token counts
- Tenant-specific policies
- OpenAI/HuggingFace request formats

They’re **built for LLMOps**, not just REST and gRPC.

## Why It Matters for Platform Teams

- Prevent runaway usage of OpenAI, Claude, or TGI
- Secure model access with OIDC, RBAC, and mTLS
- Track usage down to the prompt or user level
- Enable internal teams with self-serve, policy-governed access to models

## Conclusion

If you're running LLMs in production, you need a gateway purpose-built for AI traffic.
**Envoy AI Gateway** is that solution.

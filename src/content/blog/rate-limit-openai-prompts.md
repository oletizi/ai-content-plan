# Rate-Limit OpenAI Prompt Usage per Team with Envoy AI Gateway

Prompt usage across multiple teams can quickly spiral out of control—especially when powered by high-cost APIs like OpenAI’s. Without boundaries, a single app or developer can:

- Exceed organizational token budgets
- Starve other teams of model access
- Generate surprise costs at the end of the month

**Envoy AI Gateway** allows you to place fine-grained, policy-driven controls around OpenAI access—including request limits per team, service, or user.

## Why Per-Team Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting by IP or global quota isn’t enough in multi-team environments. Instead, you want to:

- Allocate different limits per team (e.g., marketing, support, R&D)
- Prevent noisy neighbors from disrupting others
- Provide predictability for usage and billing

## Architecture: Where Rate Limits Live

```
[ Client / App ] --> [ Envoy AI Gateway ] --> [ OpenAI API ]
                          |
                     Per-team policies
               (based on headers or JWT claims)
```

## Step 1: Identify Teams

You can identify the calling team in one of two ways:

### Option 1: JWT Claims
If using OIDC, team identity may come from a `group` or `tenant_id` claim.

### Option 2: Request Header
A custom header like `X-Team-ID` works for internal clients.

## Step 2: Define Rate Limit Policies

Here’s an example using request headers:

```yaml
rateLimits:
  - name: marketing-team
    match:
      headers:
        X-Team-ID: marketing
      path: /v1/chat/completions
    requestsPerUnit: 1000
    unit: day

  - name: research-team
    match:
      headers:
        X-Team-ID: research
      path: /v1/chat/completions
    requestsPerUnit: 10000
    unit: day
```

## Step 3: Apply Defaults and Fail Safes

To prevent abuse or misconfigurations:

- Set a default rate limit for unidentified traffic
- Use fallback policies to throttle excess usage
- Log limit hits and overages for audit and tuning

## Bonus: Token-Based Quotas

In addition to request count, you can define limits based on total tokens consumed:

```yaml
tokenBudgets:
  - tenant: marketing
    maxTokens: 50000
    period: month
```

This is particularly useful when OpenAI usage varies by prompt size and model.

## Observability: Know Who’s Hitting the Limits

Envoy AI Gateway integrates with:

- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **Grafana** dashboards by team
- **OpenTelemetry** for tracing model requests

Monitor:
- Which teams are using the most prompts
- Where limits are being hit
- Latency and error rates per team

## Conclusion

Rate limiting isn’t just about infrastructure protection anymore—it’s a vital control layer for LLM cost management, fairness, and predictability.

Envoy AI Gateway makes it easy to:
- Apply per-team usage policies
- Limit OpenAI prompt access by request or token
- Observe and adjust limits with confidence

# Protect Internal Model APIs (Seldon, BentoML) with mTLS in Envoy AI Gateway

Serving internal models in Kubernetes—via Seldon, BentoML, or Ray Serve—requires more than just network policies. Use Envoy AI Gateway to:

- Enforce client identity with mTLS
- Encrypt model traffic end-to-end
- Prevent unauthorized service access

## What You'll Learn

- How to generate and sign client certificates
- How to enable mTLS on Gateway routes
- How to rotate certificates securely

## Sample TLS Policy Snippet
```yaml
tls:
  mode: MUTUAL
  clientCertificateAuthorities:
    - secretRef: seldon-ca-secret
```

**Raise the bar on internal security—without custom firewall rules or external proxies.**

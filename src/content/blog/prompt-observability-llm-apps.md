# Add Prompt Observability to Your LLM Apps with Envoy AI Gateway

As LLM usage spreads across your organization, observability becomes essential—not just for infrastructure, but for the prompts and responses themselves.

You need visibility into:

- Who is sending prompts
- What’s being sent and returned
- How much it costs
- How fast or error-prone the experience is

Traditional monitoring tools can't answer these questions. But **Envoy AI Gateway** can.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to capture detailed prompt observability from the edge of your infrastructure—all without changing your app code.

---

## Why Prompt-Level Observability Matters

LLMs are:
- Expensive (billed per token)
- Sensitive (may contain PII)
- Complex (chained requests, dynamic prompts)

Without observability at the gateway, you’re flying blind.

Prompt-level observability helps you:
- Attribute usage by user, team, or app
- Detect anomalies and usage spikes
- Trace issues back to problematic inputs
- Optimize latency and prompt quality
- Ensure privacy and policy compliance

---

## Observability Features in Envoy AI Gateway

Envoy AI Gateway exposes rich telemetry for LLM traffic:

- **Request metadata**  
  Method, path, headers, source IP

- **JWT claims / identity context**  
  Who made the request

- **Prompt and response body metadata**  
  (lengths, token counts—not full text unless configured)

- **Latency and failure rates**

- **Token usage and cost estimation**

All metrics are emitted in Prometheus/OpenTelemetry-compatible formats.

## Example Metrics

```text
llm_prompt_tokens{team="r&d"} 45210
llm_completion_tokens{user="alice"} 38491
llm_latency_seconds{model="gpt-4"} 1.94
llm_errors_total{route="/v1/chat/completions"} 3
```

---

## Example Tracing View

Using OpenTelemetry + Jaeger or Tempo, you can visualize:

```
Trace: POST /v1/chat/completions
├── Auth: alice@company.com
├── Team: R&D
├── Tokens In: 423
├── Tokens Out: 931
├── Model: gpt-4
├── Latency: 2.4s
└── Status: 200 OK
```

---

## Privacy and Redaction

You can configure Envoy AI Gateway to:
- **Redact prompt/response bodies** entirely
- **Capture prompt structure but not values**
- **Hash or tokenize sensitive strings**

Prompt observability is **safe by default**, but flexible enough for audit and debugging.

---

## Bonus: Logging and Analytics

Logs can be shipped to:
- ELK stack
- Datadog
- FluentBit → BigQuery or S3

Use them for:
- Usage audits
- Incident investigations
- Prompt quality reviews

---

## Conclusion

Prompt observability is no longer a nice-to-have—it’s a must-have for anyone deploying LLMs at scale.

Envoy AI Gateway gives you this capability at the edge, without needing to modify every app or prompt call.

# AI Gateway vs API Gateway: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters

API gateways have been a pillar of microservices architecture—managing traffic, enforcing authentication, and providing routing and observability. But AI models and LLMs change the game.

The traffic patterns, risks, and requirements of AI are unlike anything traditional API gateways were designed for.

## Why AI Traffic Is Different

When serving or consuming AI models—like OpenAI, Hugging Face TGI, Claude, or custom LLMs—you face distinct challenges:

- **Token-based billing** — Usage is measured in tokens, not just requests.
- **High-cost payloads** — A single prompt can cost more than 1,000 API calls.
- **Sensitive content** — Prompts and completions may include PII or proprietary information.
- **Security risk** — LLMs can be exploited via prompt injection or abused by overuse.

These risks demand **a new kind of gateway**—purpose-built for AI.

## What Is an AI Gateway?

An **AI Gateway** is a modern API gateway designed specifically for AI/ML workloads. It understands token usage, supports LLM-specific policy enforcement, and integrates with observability and security tooling.

You can think of it as:
> **An API gateway with first-class support for inference, prompts, and AI-specific cost control.**

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Capability                          | Traditional API Gateway | AI Gateway |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Request rate limiting              | ✅                       | ✅         |
| Token-based rate limiting          | ❌                       | ✅         |
| Prompt/response size enforcement   | ❌                       | ✅         |
| Auth via OIDC / mTLS               | ✅                       | ✅         |
| LLM observability (token usage, latency) | ❌                | ✅         |
| Policy enforcement per model route | ⚠️ Partial               | ✅         |
| Prompt sanitization (Wasm)         | ❌                       | ✅         |
| Cost-aware quota enforcement       | ❌                       | ✅         |
| Support for multi-tenancy          | ⚠️ Varies                | ✅         |
| Kubernetes Gateway API integration | ⚠️ Rare                  | ✅         |

## When Should You Use an AI Gateway?

You need an AI Gateway if you’re:

- Exposing model endpoints to internal devs or teams
- Using OpenAI or Claude with SSO and RBAC
- Deploying Hugging Face or custom models behind a load balancer
- Concerned about inference costs, abuse, or auditability
- Supporting multiple products or tenants that consume AI

## The Bottom Line

Traditional API gateways are not equipped to handle the unique access, observability, and control needs of AI workloads.

**AI Gateways fill that gap.**

They bring policy control, cost governance, and secure access to a new class of APIs: generative, sensitive, and expensive.

AI models are powering everything from chatbots to copilots—but most teams are exposing them through insecure, unobservable, and expensive APIs. Envoy AI Gateway solves this by putting AI access behind a secure, policy-aware, and Kubernetes-native gateway.

## The Problem

Productionizing AI brings serious challenges:

- No easy way to apply authentication or rate limits
- Token sprawl and runaway inference costs
- Lack of observability into model usage—or abuse

## The Solution

**Envoy AI Gateway** is built on Envoy Proxy and the Kubernetes Gateway API. It gives platform teams a modern, secure, and extensible way to manage AI inference traffic.

### Key Benefits

- ✅ Enforce mTLS, OIDC, and RBAC for LLM endpoints
- ✅ Control usage with token-aware rate limits and quotas
- ✅ Observe prompt traffic, latency, and errors
- ✅ Native Kubernetes and GitOps support
